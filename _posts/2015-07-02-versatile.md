Consumed with new age technologies I have reached a near stagnant state of desire to incorporate myself with anything else but furthering my apprehensions in such an art. Over the past two decades I have accumulate a twenty year old perspective as to what a versatile designer is and strives to be. A "Jack of all trades" would be quite an understatement as they lack mastery in any given skill. A true designer not only spends their entire life mastering every task at hand, but consistently improves on previous masterpieces each and every moment possible. Someone who takes a problem with absolutely no solution and finds a pictures worth satisfy the criteria. One that is willing to improve oneself daily among all trades. This individual not only spends the majority of their time learning, but learns through teaching others.
I could spend an eternity explaining to one who I am and what I can do, but only a split moment in time, a few lines of text on a screen, and an open book like myself could show oneself what I am not.
I am not just another versatile designer.
